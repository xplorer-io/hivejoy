## 🍯 About

Hive Joy Marketplace is a digital platform connecting verified Australian honey producers and beekeeping businesses directly with consumers. The platform unites trusted, traceable sellers of honey and hive-derived products under one verified ecosystem—ensuring purity, transparency, and fair trade across the Australian market.

### Vision

To become the national trusted marketplace for Australian honey and hive products—empowering local producers and protecting consumers from counterfeit or imported honey.

### Problem We Solve

Australia's honey industry faces widespread authenticity issues. Imported and blended honey dominates retail shelves, often misleading customers. Local producers lack a unified digital platform to showcase and sell directly, while consumers struggle to identify genuine, traceable Australian honey.

### Our Solution

Hive Joy provides a verified-only marketplace where every seller must be an Australian producer with traceable operations. No resellers or imported products. Each listing includes provenance details, producer profile, and verification badge.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Verified Producers Only**: Sellers must produce their own honey or hive products in Australia
- **Traceable Origin**: Each item links to its source region and beekeeper via batch-based provenance
- **Australian-Only Ecosystem**: Exclusively for Australian businesses and consumers
- **Hive Joy Seal**: Quality certification to identify verified producers
- **Secure Digital Infrastructure**: Web platform + mobile app with integrated payments, geo-filters, and advanced search by floral source or region

## 📋 Key Concepts

### Producer Verification
All sellers must go through a verification process proving they are Australian honey producers (not resellers or importers).

### Batch-Based Traceability
Every product listing must be linked to a Batch record containing:
- Region (state/area)
- Harvest date and extraction date
- Floral source tags
- Producer identity

### Platform Rules
1. All sellers must be producers themselves (no resellers, retailers, or importers)
2. Every product listing must be linked to a traceable source via a Batch record
3. Australian market focus for both sellers and buyers
4. Honey is the MVP core product
